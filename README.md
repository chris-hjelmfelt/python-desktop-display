I hope to display various notes and images that are editable and can run as a desktop application  


Make executables with PyInstaller   (helloworld.py)   
> pip install -U pyinstaller   

> python -m PyInstaller helloworld.py --onefile   



Display an image inside my application with tkinter   (displayimage.py)   
(installed by default with Python)    
> python imagedisplay.py   



so far I can't get these two to work together but I don't have time for it right now
